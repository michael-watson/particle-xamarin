# Particle Xamarin Cloud SDK

Particle Xamarin Cloud SDK enables Xamarin apps to interact with Particle-powered connected products via the Particle Cloud. Itâ€™s an easy-to-use wrapper for Particle REST API. The Cloud SDK will allow you to:

- Manage user sessions for the Particle Cloud (access tokens, encrypted session management)
- Claim/Unclaim devices for a user account
- Get a list of instances of user's Particle devices
- Read variables from devices
- Invoke functions on devices
- Publish events from the mobile app and subscribe to events coming from devices *(New!)*

All cloud operations take place asynchronously, allowing you to build beautiful responsive apps for your Particle products and projects.

**Beta notice**

This SDK is still under development and is currently released as Beta. Although tested, bugs and issues may be present. Some code might require cleanup. 

## Getting Started

- Available via [NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ParticleCloud/1.0.0).
    - Supports Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.Forms and Windows
- Fork this library to get access to the SDK and a full working sample

## Usage

Cloud SDK usage involves two basic classes: first is `ParticleCloud` which is a singleton object that enables all basic cloud operations such as user authentication, device listing, claiming etc. Second class is `ParticleDevice` which is an instance representing a claimed device in the current user session. Each object enables device-specific operation such as: getting its info, invoking functions and reading variables from it.

### Common tasks

Here are few examples for the most common use cases to get your started:

#### Logging in to Particle cloud
You don't need to worry about access tokens, SDK takes care of that for you

```C#
var loginSuccess = await ParticleCloud.SharedInstance.LoginWithUserAsync("username@email.com"","password");
if(loginSuccess)
    System.DIagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Logged in to cloud")
else
    System.DIagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Wrong credentials or no internet connectivity, please try again")
```

#### Get a list of all devices
List the devices that belong to currently logged in user and find a specific device by name:

```C#
var devices = await ParticleCloud.SharedInstance.GetDevicesAsync();
```

#### Read a variable from a Particle device (Core/Photon/Electron)
Assuming here that `myPhoton` is an active instance of `SparkDevice` class which represents a device claimed to current user:
 
```C#
var temperature = await ParticleDevice.GetVariableAsync("temperature");
```

#### Call a function on a Particle device (Core/Photon/Electron)
Invoke a function on the device and pass a list of parameters to it, `resultCode` on the completion block will represent the returned result code of the function on the device.
This example also demonstrates usage of the new `NSURLSessionDataTask` object returned from every SDK function call.

```C#
var response = await ParticleDevice.CallFunctionAsync("lightShow");
```
#### Get an instance of a device
Get a device instance by its ID:
   
```C#
var device = await ParticleCloud.SharedInstance.GetDeviceAsync("53fa73265066544b16208184");
```

#### Rename a device
you can simply set the `.name` property or use -rename() method if you need a completion block to be called (for example updating a UI after renaming was done):
 
```C#
var success = await ParticleDevice.SetNameAsync("New Name");
```

#### Logout
Also clears user session and access token

```C#
ParticleCloud.SharedInstance.Logout();
```

### ParticleEvents
Events were implemented at both the ParticleCloud instance and ParticleDevice instance. Each subscription will return a ```Guid``` that is used to unsubscribe from that event. All Subscribed Events are started on a new thread throught ```Task.Factory``` with completion options set to ```LongRunning```. It is important to take this into consideration when subscribing to Events. Multiple subscriptions could slow down performance on any other web requests within application. 

#### Subscribe to all events with prefix
Subscribing is easy, just provide the event handler you want invoked as messages are received.  

```C#
var uniqueId = await ParticleCloud.SharedInstance.SubscribeToAllEventsWithPrefixAsync(eventNamePrefix,  
    (object sender, ParticleEventArgs e) => doSomethingWithEvent()
);
```
#### Subscribe to all events with prefix for a specific device
Only difference is we provide the Id of the device we want to subscribe to.   

```C#
var uniqueId = await ParticleCloud.SharedInstance.SubscribeToMyDevicesEventsWithPrefixAsync(eventNamePrefix, deviceId, 
    (object sender, ParticleEventArgs e) => doSomethingWithEvent()
);
```
#### Unsubscribe to a event
Just provide the Guid and the event will be fully disposed. All cached data is returned as an ```Event``` object and then disposed of to keep the ParticleCloud instance light weight.  

```C#
await ParticleCloud.SharedInstance.UnsubscribeFromEventWithIdAsync(uniqueId);
```
#### Publish an event
Publishing an event is easy, just provide the event details: eventName, eventData, boolean whether the event is public and time for it to live in the Cloud.   

```C#
await ParticleCloud.SharedInstance.PublishEventWithNameAsync(eventName, eventData, false, 60);
```
#### Wire up OnStart and OnError
Sometimes we may want to know when the connection is starting or when an error is returned by the Cloud. We can do this on each subscribed event. Nothing is wired up by default to maximize performance.

```C#
var uniqueId = await ParticleCloud.SharedInstance.SubscribeToAllEventsWithPrefixAsync(eventNamePrefix,  
    (object sender, ParticleEventArgs e) => doSomethingWithEvent()
);
var eventSource = ParticleCloud.SharedInstance.SubscibedEvents[UniqueId];
eventSource.OnOpen += HandleOpen;
eventSource.OnError += HandleClose;
```



### OAuth client configuration

If you're creating an app you're required to provide the `ParticleCloud` class with OAuth clientId and secret.
Those are used to identify users coming from your specific app to the Particle Cloud.
Please follow the procedure decribed [in our guide](https://docs.particle.io/guide/how-to-build-a-product/web-app/#creating-an-oauth-client) to create those strings,
then in your platform specific launching class you can supply those credentials by setting the following properties in `ParticleCloud` singleton:


```C#
ParticleCloud.SharedInstance.OAuthClientId = "ClientID";
ParticleCloud.SharedInstance.OAuthClientSecret = "ClientID";
```

**Important**
Those credentials should be kept as secret. It is essentially a key value store for enviroment and application keys.
It's a good security practice to keep production keys out of developer hands.
